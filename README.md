# Bayes-Rule-inferences
Using Bayes’ Rule to make inferences based on evidence is crucial skill for data scientists. Bayes’ Rule lets us find the best explanation for what we see, and lets us quantify our confidence in that explanation.

Your friend has two pairs of dice. She rolls the first pair and notes their sum (But does not tell you what that sum is!) She repeatedly rolls the second pair and tells you if the new sum is higher than (H), lower than(L), or equal to (E) the first pair. You are trying to guess what the sum of the first pair of dice is.
Based on the squence of H, L, and E, you need to figure out the probability of each possible sum.
For example, if she tells you HHL, you would compute the following probabilities (to six places after the decimal point):


You will run the code as below:
